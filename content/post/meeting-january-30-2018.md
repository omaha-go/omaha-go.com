Hello again!  It's been a while, but we're meeting at last!
<!--more-->

# Where & When!
Tuesday, January 30th starting at 5:30. Once again we are meeting at the [Flywheel basement space on 14th, between Harney and Howard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flywheel+Underground/@41.2558956,-95.9367249,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87938fae8a563f31:0x86e1c4cb47b336ec!8m2!3d41.2558916!4d-95.9345362). There will be a sign at the stairs so you know where to go down if you havenâ€™t been there before, or you can contact me [https://twitter.com/jmhobbs](@jmhobbs) or on the Gophers slack under the same name.

# Presentations!

I will be presenting a short overview of the rapidly advancing [Buffalo web framework](https://gobuffalo.io/), and I'm happy to say that [Ben Stevinson](https://twitter.com/benstevinson) of [Median](https://hellomedian.com/) will be talking about using Go for serverless applications.  Exciting, because [AWS recently announced support for Go on Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-go-support-for-aws-lambda/).

I hope to see you there!
