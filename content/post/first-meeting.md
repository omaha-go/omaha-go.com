# When!

Tuesday, August 15th starting at 5:30.  If you can’t make it at 5:30, don’t sweat it, we will be there for at least an hour.  If you can’t do Tuesday’s (in general) please let me know.  Part of this first meeting is working out what the best meeting day and time will be for our collective schedules!

# Where!

Flywheel is letting us use their [basement space on 14th between Harney and Howard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Flywheel+Underground/@41.2558956,-95.9367249,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87938fae8a563f31:0x86e1c4cb47b336ec!8m2!3d41.2558916!4d-95.9345362).  There will be a sign at the stairs so you know where to go down if you haven’t been there before.

# What!

We will do general introductions, and discuss what we all hope to get from this meetup.  I will also give a short presentation on the Bolt key value database if we have time.

I hope to see you there!
